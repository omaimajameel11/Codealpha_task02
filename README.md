# Stock Prediction

Time Series data is a series of data points indexed in time order. Time series data is everywhere, so manipulating them is important for any data analyst or data scientist.

In this repository, we will discover and explore data from the stock market, particularly some technology stocks (Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft). We will learn how to use yfinance to get stock information, and visualize different aspects of it using Seaborn and Matplotlib. we will look at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. We will also be predicting future stock prices through a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) method!

## We'll be answering the following questions along the way:

1. What was the change in price of the stock over time?

2. What was the daily return of the stock on average?
   
3. What was the moving average of the various stocks?
   
4. What was the correlation between different stocks?
   
5. How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?

6. How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior? (Predicting the closing price stock price of APPLE inc using LSTM)

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of historical stock price data for a chosen company. The dataset includes features such as:

- **Date**: The trading date.
- **Open**: The opening price of the stock on that date.
- **High**: The highest price of the stock on that date.
- **Low**: The lowest price of the stock on that date.
- **Close**: The closing price of the stock on that date.
- **Volume**: The trading volume of the stock on that date.

### Data Source

The stock price data can be obtained from financial data providers such as Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or other reliable sources. For this project, the Yahoo Finance API or `yfinance` library in Python can be used to fetch the data.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Loading the Data**
   - Load the historical stock price data into a pandas DataFrame.

2. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Identify and handle any missing values in the dataset, if present.

3. **Feature Selection**
   - Select relevant features for the LSTM model. Typically, the `Close` price is used as the target variable for prediction.

4. **Data Normalization**
   - Normalize the feature values to scale the data, which helps in faster convergence during training. Use MinMaxScaler from scikit-learn for normalization.

5. **Creating Sequences**
   - Create sequences of stock prices to feed into the LSTM model. For example, use the past 60 days' prices to predict the next day's price.

6. **Train-Test Split**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Model Building

1. **LSTM Model Architecture**
   - Design an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras.
   - The architecture typically includes:
     - Input layer
     - LSTM layers
     - Dense (fully connected) layers
     - Output layer (predicting the next day's closing price)

2. **Model Compilation**
   - Compile the model using an appropriate loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error) and optimizer (e.g., Adam).

3. **Model Training**
   - Train the LSTM model on the training dataset.
   - Use early stopping and model checkpointing to prevent overfitting and to save the best model.

## Model Evaluation

1. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

2. **Visualization**
   - Plot the predicted stock prices against the actual stock prices to visualize the model's performance.

## Usage

1. **Input Data**
   - The system requires historical stock price data for prediction. Ensure the data is preprocessed and normalized as described.

2. **Prediction**
   - Use the trained LSTM model to predict future stock prices based on the historical data sequences.

## Example Workflow

1. **Loading and Preprocessing Data**
   - Load the stock price data using `yfinance` or any other source.
   - Preprocess the data: handle missing values, normalize, and create sequences.

2. **Building and Training the Model**
   - Design the LSTM model architecture.
   - Compile and train the model using the training dataset.

3. **Evaluating the Model**
   - Evaluate the model on the test dataset.
   - Visualize the predicted vs. actual stock prices.

4. **Making Predictions**
   - Use the trained model to make future stock price predictions.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a stock price prediction model using LSTM. By following the outlined steps, you can create a robust model capable of predicting future stock prices based on historical data.
